How to find converted items in Miro
-----------------------------------

When the conversion is done, a new item will appear in your **Video** or
**Music** tab with the same name as the item that you converted with the
target tacked on to the end.

How to find converted items on disk

Files that are converted are stored in a `Converted` folder on your disk
drive.

You can get to the `Converted` folder at any time by choosing
