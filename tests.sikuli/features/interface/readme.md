Miro Interface
==============

The Miro user interface consists of 4 basic parts. Before walking
through the functionality you should understand the terms used to
describe each piece. This will make the rest of the manual easier to
understand.

When you first start Miro, it looks something like this:

![image](_static/interface_interface.png)
The labeled areas are these:

1.  This is the **menu**.

2.  This is the **sidebar**. Clicking on the tabs opens it in the main
    view.

3.  This is the **main view**. This screenshot is showing the browser
    display.

4.  This is the **playback bar**. This bar has controls for playback,
    fullscreen, details of the item being played, the timeline, and the
    volume control.

The menu
--------

The menu is pretty straight-forward. It works like menus for other
applications.

The sidebar
-----------

The sidebar allows you to navigate to see everything that Miro is
managing. Each item in the sidebar is called a *tab*. Clicking on a
particular tab will display it's content in the main view.

Starting at the top, we have the following tabs:

-   **Miro**

    Clicking on this tab brings up the Miro Guide in the **main view**.

-   **Videos**, **Music**, **Misc**, **Downloading**, **Converting**

    The **Videos** and **Music** tabs show you all the video and music
    that you have in your Miro library.

    The **Misc** tab will show up if you have misc items that are
    neither video nor music. For example, if you downloaded a torrent
    that has PDFs in it, those PDFs would show up in the **Misc** tab.
    If you don't have any misc items, then this tab won't show up.

    The **Downloading** tab shows up when you're downloading or
    uploading.

    The **Converting** tab shows up when you're converting items.

-   **Video Search**

    Clicking on this tab brings up the video search view which allows
    you to search Internet video sites for content. This is covered more
    in :ref:\`searching-video-websites\`.

-   **Connect**

    The **Connect** tab manages shares and devices. You can read more
    about these things in :ref:\`sharing-chapter\` and
    :ref:\`devices-chapter\`.

-   **Sources**

    The **Sources** tab holds sources for media. A source is any website
    you want bookmarked to view inside of Miro. Sources are covered in
    :ref:\`sources-chapter\`.

-   **Stores**

-   **Podcasts**

    The **Podcasts** section holds podcast feeds. Podcasts are covered
    in :ref:\`podcasts-chapter\`.

-   **Playlists**

    The **Playlists** section holds playlists. Playlists are covered in
    :ref:\`playlists-chapter\`.

The main view
-------------

There are several different kinds of main views depending on what's
selected in the sidebar.

### The browser view

![image](_static/interface_browser_view.png)
Miro has a built-in web-browser. There are browser controls along the
top of the browser allowing you to go forward and backward in the
history, reload the page, go back to "home" and open the current page in
a browser outside of Miro.

On Windows, the browser is XULRunner-based like Firefox.

On GNU/Linux and OSX, the browser is Webkit-based like Safari and
Chrome.

### The item view

The standard view has a header and a list of items in the view. In the
header you'll find the name of the view you're looking at and buttons
for executing tasks related to that view and changing view settings.

In the footer, you'll find additional controls and that's where the bar
that opens and closes the item details pane is located.

There's a toggle in the upper right hand corner of the item view that
lets you toggle between "standard view" and "list view".

![image](_static/interface_listview_toggle.png)
The left button shows the list of items in "standard view" and looks
like this:

![image](_static/interface_items_standardview.png)
The right button shows the list of items in "list view" and looks like
this:

![image](_static/interface_items_listview.png)
Items can be sorted by clicking on the column headings. Clicking on the
column heading twice will reverse the sort.

..index:: interface; details panel

### The details panel

The list and standard views both have a details panel at the bottom that
can be opened and closed by clicking on the top edge of the panel:

Click on the top edge of the panel to open and close it.
