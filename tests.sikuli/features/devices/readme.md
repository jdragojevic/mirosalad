For more information, see the [full list of supported

Connecting a device
-------------------

Your device needs to be mounted for Miro to access it. Your phone has a
*USB storage mode* which can be enabled once it is connected to your
computer via a USB cable. Flash drives and other external drives will
generally be mounted automatically.

If your device isn't mounted, Miro will not see any files and will ask
you to mount it.

If you have connected a device and don't see it in the sidebar:

1.  Click on the **Connect** tab in the sidebar
2.  In the main view, check the *Show all attached devices and drives*
    checkbox

Device Settings
---------------

To edit your device settings, click on your device in the sidebar. In
the Miro main view, click on the **Settings** button.

Under settings you can specify:

-   *Name of Device*: how it will appear in the Sidebar
-   *Video Conversion*: should default to your device-specific
    resolution.
-   *Audio Conversion*: Default to the format recognized by your device.
-   *Video storage directory*: Where Video files are stored on your
    device.
-   *Audio storage directory*: Where Audio files are stored on your
    device.

For Audio and Video conversions, Miro defaults to the best setting for
the detected device. There is also a *Copy* option available if you do
not want or need to perform conversions with the syncing.

Syncing media to your device
----------------------------

You can copy video and music files to your device either with a simple
drag-and-drop or by configuring your settings to sync files from
specific podcasts or playlists.

The output format of the the files is specified in the device's
**Settings** panel described above.

To sync files by drag-and-drop:

1.  Select the file or files you want to sync
2.  Drag the files to the device tab in the sidebar

To automatically detect podcast files for syncing:

1.  Click on the device in the sidebar
2.  Click on the **Podcasts** button in the Main View
3.  Check the *Sync Podcasts* checkbox
4.  Optionally choose to the box to sync only unplayed items
5.  Click the box alongside each podcast you would like to sync or
    alternatively click the **Select All** button.

When Miro detects that files are available for syncing, the number of
available files is displayed above the **Sync Now** button.

Click **Sync Now** to start the sync process.

You can use the **Cancel** button to halt the syncing process.

To automatically detect playlist items for syncing:

1.  Click on the device in the sidebar
2.  Click on the **Playlists** button in the main view
3.  Check the *Sync Playlists* checkbox
4.  Optionally choose to the box to sync only unplayed items
5.  Click the box alongside each playlist you would like to sync or
    alternatively click the **Select All** button

When Miro detects that files are available for syncing, the number of
available files is displayed above the **Sync Now** button.

Click **Sync Now** to start the sync process.

You can use the **Cancel** button to halt the syncing process.

As additional items are added to the playlist, they will be added to the
list of items available for syncing.

Syncing media from your device
------------------------------

You can copy video and music files from your device by clicking on the
**Copy to Miro** button for the item.

You can convert items from your device, and the output file will be
stored in your Miro library (great for video cameras).

Trouble-shooting
----------------

### Miro won't work with my iPhone/iPad/iPod

Miro doesn't currently support Apple media devices. We hope to implement
this in a future release.

### Miro doesn't support my device

If Miro doesn't support your device, you can show all the devices Miro
knows about by checking the *Show all attached devices and drives* in
the **Connect** tab.

If Miro doesn't support your device, please help us add it! Check out
[the "Adding Support"
page](http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/DeviceSupport/AddingSupport)
for instructions on how to find the information and fill out [our device
support request form](http://bit.ly/mirodevicehelp).

### Miro doesn't make playlists from my device

Device Video and Music tabs look like the Miro sidebar tabs, however,
there are some limitations.

Device items can't be dragged to a Miro playlist.
