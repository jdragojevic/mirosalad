Edit Item Metadata 
--------------


Edit Items Panel
----------------

The Edit Items panel allows users to manually set metadata values for items displayed in the library.
It can be used for single or multiple item edits


The dialog is accessible via the menus.  The menu option is activated with either a single item or multiple items are selected.  The dialog can be opened by either:
- Right-click context menu
- Item context menu
- File -> Edit Item
- Keyboard Shortcut: CTRL/CMD + I

Type
----
Items are automatically catagorized by miro as:
- Music
- Video
- Misc

Files are displayed in the corresponding library tab. 

In the case that Miro metadata processes have mis-categorized an item, the user can manually change the item type setting either by dragging the item to the tab that represents the desired file type, or by editing it via the Edit Item Details panel.
