External playback
-----------------

Miro supports a very wide variety of video and audio codecs, but
sometimes there are bugs and sometimes there are formats that are
supported better by other players. For this reason, you may want to play
the media item with an external player.

### Playing a single item with an external player

To play a single item with the external player:

1.  Select the item you want to play.
2.  Right-click on the item to get the context menu.
3.  Select **Play Externally**.

### Configure Miro to play everything with an external player

To configure Miro to play everything with an external player:

1.  Select the **File** -\> **Preferences** menu item.
2.  Click on the **Playback** tab.
3.  Uncheck *Play media in Miro*.

Whenever you play an item, Miro will pass the item to your operating
system which will open the item in the application you have associated
with that item type.

To configure which application is associated with that item type,
consult your operating system documentation.
