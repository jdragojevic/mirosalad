While browsing around in a website, you will find links to media items.
Clicking on one of these links will download the item in Miro.

Miro may recognize media items on websites like YouTube and you will see
a **Download this video** button in the browser navigation bar. Clicking
on that button will download the item.

Downloading an item
-------------------

Miro can also download items that aren't in feeds that you've subscribed
to or from video search.

1.  Select the **File** -\> **Download from a URL** menu item. This will
    launch the **New Download** dialog window.

2.  Fill in the url of the item.

    *On Windows and GTKX11 platforms*, you can press Shift+Insert or
    Ctrl+V to paste a url from the system clipboard into this dialog
    box.

    *On OSX*, you can press Apple+V to paste a url from the system
    clipboard into this dialog box.

3.  Click on the **OK** button.

Miro will now attempt to download this item. If the download is
successful, then the item will show up in the sidebar in the **Videos**
or **Music** tab of the **Library** depending on whether the media item
is video or audio.

If the url leads to something that's not a media item, Miro will pop up
a dialog box telling you as such and asking you what you want it to do.

Torrents
--------

Miro is a torrent client and can download torrents. You can download a
torrent with Miro in the same ways that you can download any other media
item.

Once a torrent has completed downloading, it switches to seeding.

The torrent will continue seeding until you press the **Stop seeding**
button on the item.

If you want to set an upload ratio so that Miro will automatically stop
seeding an item when a specified upload to download ratio has been
reached, you can set that in the :ref:\`configuring-chapter\`.
